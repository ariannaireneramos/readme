# My Awesome Project
We are the Pit-Crew! All of you have been on the internet right? All of you guys know that on the internet STEM classes and majors are often demonstrated to be incredibly difficult. And don’t get me wrong they can be difficult, but we are going to need the next generation to have a next generation of ideas. Without the new generation, how will we continue to develop the field that you are in now? With our F1 car inspired robot, we can introduce the idea that STEM can be fun to new developing minds. With the combination of a popular subject of entertainment and an engineering field, kids will associate a familiar idea with a new unfamiliar territory. By building our F1 inspired robot and watching it work by following them around, kids will have fun while doing something traditionally difficult. Our group is a combination of mechanical and biomedical engineers as well as people who have been in the position of wanting to explore STEM. This gives us special qualifications to relate to our audience and deliver a product they will learn from and have fun with.
